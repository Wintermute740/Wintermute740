<p>It's not quite an ARG, but it has many elements of one. Horror author David Viergutz has created a very ARG-like experience delivered as two letters per month for a year, which I bought for my wife some time back. I decided I wanted my own copy, so I ordered it for myself as well about a month later, putting me two letters behind her in the experience. There are websites to visit, phone numbers to call, etc., though I don't believe they will have much impact on the story other than making it feel more interactive. I'm currently eight letters in, out of twenty-four, and it is starting to get a bit creepy. The story is told as letters back and forth between a reader and David, with several other artifacts being included along the way. I've been enjoying it so much that I've been thinking CiW could use the same type of treatment, and if I could get more than an introductory letter, I'd probably launch something similar. ;)

<p>The official <a href="http://www.lg15.com">lg15.com</a> has been down for a few weeks now, and I have contacted Miles about it. While he responded when I first noticed it by saying he would check into it and asking if I wanted to help maintain it, he has not responded to any further inquiries. I do not know where it stands, but it appears that the web server has been shut down for some reason. It should be a matter of the hosting company starting it back up, and then the official site is back.</a>

<p>That said, I am not one to wait around. ;) Since I have a bunch of the databases from when I previously helped to restore lgpedia, I set up an unofficial mirror at <a href="http://lg15.cassieiswatching.com">lg15.cassieiswatching.com</a>. I couldn't get the old version of phpBB2 to work properly, so I upgraded the forums to phpBB3. There's a quirk with the "last post" author and date, but otherwise all the old posts from 2007-ish are still there. For lgpedia, I just linked to an existing fan mirror of it.</p>

<p>I built this on top of a couple old projects I had written for Cassie Watchers. The first one was a <a href="http://lg15.cassieiswatching.com/index.php">search</a> for the forums. The second was another search, this time for the <a href="http://lg15.cassieiswatching.com/comments.php">comments</a> from the old Wordpress version of the site. And finally, I had put together a list of all the <a href="http://lg15.cassieiswatching.com/Videos.php">videos</a> as a list of the old posts along with their comments.</p>

<p>I have an old USR Total Control from Greenapple, and have been pondering how to put it back into service for awhile now. Looks like these guys have figured it out:<p>

<p>I hope to be able to duplicate their work. Why? Is it practical? No, it's not practical. But because I can? lol</p>

<p>I intended to do updates of my daughter's Cross Country <a href="https://www.nitemarecafe.com/running.html">running</a> times, but time got away from me. Instead, here's summary of her 2024 season:</p>
<p>Her first 1 mile race that I posed about was on 8/24, and she finished in 10:27.</p>
<p>During her following practice on 8/26, she ran a 14:36 mile. The slower time is probably due to the hotter weather, the practice course being a bit rougher, and she had just competed in her first race and didn't have any recocery time.<p>
<p>She ran a 12:31 mile on 8/31.</p>
<p>On 9/6, she had her first 2K race and finished in 13:54.</p>
<p>On 9/17, she broke a 10 minute mile with a time of 9:52.</p>
<p>Three days later, she ran another 2K and finished in 13:08.</p>
<p>Her last race of the season was her longest yet, a 3K which she finished in 20:06.</p>
<p>To cap off her season, there was one last timed mile at practice the following Monday, which she finished in 9:19, which was over five minutes faster than her first practice timed run and a over a minute faster than her first race.</p>
<p>I am so proud of this girl's accomplishments this season, setting a new personal best almost every time she ran during her very first season of cross country.</p>

<p>I don't like running a blog where I cannot interact with users, so comments are now enabled via <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>. Unfortunately, it embeds 3rd-party JavaScript into the site in order to do so, but the only other way would be to do some forms, receiving those forms via email, and processing them via some hacked-together script. Since I prefer to moderate comments to keep spam away anyhow, this might not be so bad a solution, but Disqus is a little easier to do without much effort ;)

<p>My 10yo daughter is in Cross Country this year, and this is her finishing her first-ever race with a 10:27.42 mile. This is about 2 minutes faster than an average 10yo beginner, and just a few seconds faster than an average 10yo novice. This papa is so proud of his little girl.</p>

<p>At this point, I can't even remember where the title of this post comes from. All I know is that ever since I read that somewhere else, every iteration of this blog has had a post with that title. I had to keep the tradition alive. ;)</p>
<p>I am a fan of paranormal shows. UFOs, ghost hunting, etc. I've had some experience which, when I was younger, attributed to the paranormal. I still cannot explain those experiences, but I no longer attribute them to something paranormal. It's easy to miss some detail that would explain things perfectly and have your imagination fill in the rest, especially if it were primed to do so.</p>
<p>But this post isn't about my experiences. This is about a rabbit hole that I just got sucked into by my 10yo daughter. We had taken my girls to King's Island a week or so ago, and my wife had pointed out a restaurant which she thought was the one featured on <i>Ghost Hunters</i> because my 10yo loves watching reruns of the show. This morning, my 10yo wanted to watch that episode, which is S8E01, "Roller Ghoster." My daughter mentioned that she didn't think it was the same restaurant that my wife had mentioned, but thought maybe it had changed names. She was correct on the first count. My wife had pointed out the wrong restaurant.</p>

<p>During my research I discovered a <a href="https://browsingtheatlas.com/2012/10/05/the-ghosts-of-kings-island/">brief post</a> by an area local who remembered a story about a teen who fell to death climbing the Eifel Tower on May 13, 1983. Naturally, since the claim is that it happened on Friday the 13th, the first stop was to verify that the date was, indeed, a Friday. I was somewhat surprised that it was. "Okay," I thought. So, someone made something up because it was a Friday the 13th. But the post did include a name, and searching for "John Harter 1983 obituary" confirms the rest of the story (aside from the underage drinking, but being 1983 and a graduation celbration, that detail isn't much of a stretch). Though it's hard to say if there's more to the article behind a paywall, or of the blurb is all it got, it did make the <h ref=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/15/us/death-at-graduation-party.html">NY Times</a>. I would love to know what ghost stories surround this incident.</p>

<p>This also reminds me of a project I've been meaning to do for the <a href="https://www.nitemarecafe.com/tag_ghosts-of-ohio.html">Ghosts of Ohio</a> section of the site. I need to catalog, review, and further research the <i>Ghost Hunters</i> episodes which take place in my home state. If anyone wants to contribute stories related to any of the <i>Ghost Hunters</i> episode locations, or <a href="https://www.nitemarecafe.com/tag_ghosts-of-ohio.html">Ghosts of Ohio</a> in general, email me at wintermute AT nitematecafe DOT com.</p>

<p>I just finished a rewatch of <i>Northern Exposure</i> and I forgot how delightfully quirky it had gotten in spots. I also realize that when it was on first-run, I must have stopped watching somewhere during the 5th season.
</p>
<p>Overall, it holds up fairly well but definitely has a certain 90's charm. If this were my first watch, at my current age (instead of a younger adult), I'm not sure if that charm would have drawn me in if I weren't already a fan of the characters.</p>
<p>If you were a fan before, it's worth watching again. If you weren't, it's still worth catching a few episodes to see if the charm and the quirkiness draws you in. You'll chuckle a lot, and probably laugh a lot. You'll probably come away caring about the characters, because the show also makes you feel for them.</p>
