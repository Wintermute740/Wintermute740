Old Posts
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>I am going to be going through old posts and importing any which I still find to be interesting, backdating them to when they were originally posted. I will also continue creating new posts as time allows.

De-Googling
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>I am in the process of (mostly) removing Google from my life, and the first step is to move my site to <a href="https://github.com/Wintermute740">github</a>, of all places. There are some things I won't be able to get away from completely, such as my gmail account, but I can do things such as use an actual email client in order to minimize the impact. My phone is going the be the biggest challenge, but is probably the lowest priority on my list.
</p>
<p>If you're reading this at my domain, then DNS has propogated and all my old posts are elsewhere. I can still access them, but I would need to find a way to automate migrating them to here. I can easily export them, and then it would be a matter of some Linux-fu. The one thing I'm going to miss is comments, even though they were rarely used. Disqus is an option, but I can always be reached at the email address in the footer if you have any suggestions ;)

Area5150
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>Here is an amazing video of the audience reaction of a demo running on an original IBM PC with CGA graphics:
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-xJZ9I4iqg8?si=aX6LjYV_OUKdZt1u" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>
And because I just recently acquired and restored an original IBM 5150 PC, here it is running on mine:

The original welcome post
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>Welcome to the new Nitemare Cafe site! Right now, posting is kind of a free-for-all, so be gentle! I'll probably make some changes to it in the near future, as I get time. <br><br/>(this post was originally posted using custom blog scripts)</p>
