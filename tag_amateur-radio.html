<p>A couple of years ago, I got my General Class amateur radio license, callsign KE8UXR. Since then, I picked up a cheap Baofeng radio and listened in for a bit, but even after 2+ years, I still have not made me first contact. I'm just not that into voice communications.
</p>
<p>This is about to change. I have ordered an inexpensive kit to get started in packet radio, and will be building a rugged "cyberdeck" with my Raspberry Pi 5 for use with amateur radio and astronomy. More information is forthcoming, but I thought I'd start documenting the journey.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, I previously purchased a Beofeng UV-5R HT, which I currently keep in my van in case of emergency. My plan is to use this radio with my Raspberry Pi 5, and a recently purchased Digirig Mobile, which is basically a USB sound card with PTT with cables available to interface it to various radios. I plan on getting a rugged case, similar to a Pelican case, to house the build and will be basically following the millions of online build tutorials for this. I also have a couple of SDRs, including a HackRF, and may implement one of more of these as well in order to play with amateur radio astronomy.</p>
<p>My goals for the project is to have this as self-contained with the ability to use various digital radio modes. It should be rugged and weatherized. It should be battery-powered with the ability to charge via solar. It should include offline resources in case the Internet is unavailable. And it should include astronomy resources as well, as a portable rugged computer will come in handy for that hobby as well.</p>
